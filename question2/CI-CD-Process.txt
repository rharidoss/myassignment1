CI process
------------
Assumption:
   Jenkins is the CI server.
   Jenkins agent ( with label "build") has all the necessary software to build the docker container
   Code is checked into Git along with "Dockerfile" and "Jenkinsfile"
   The deployment happens on a Jenkins agent with label "qa"
   The user will test the code by using the qa machine url ( https://qaserver:80 )
1. Create a Jenkins pipeline job 
2. Configure git repository and branch to pull code
3. Configure build trigger to start the build as soon as the code committed
4. Specify Jenkins file location in the git repository
